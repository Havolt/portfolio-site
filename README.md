# portfolio-site

This is my portfolio site built using Vue.js.

It is designed to be responsive and to fit content on a single screen without the for the user to scroll up and down a long document.

A pick of some of my work has been placed inside the portfolio and updated.

You can find a live version of my portfolio site at www.markfz.com or https://havolt-portfolio.herokuapp.com/
